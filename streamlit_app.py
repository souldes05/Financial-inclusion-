This model was trained on demographic data from approximately 23,524 individuals across East Africa (Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda) to predict financial inclusion.

**Model Performance:**
- Accuracy: 86.16%
- The model uses Random Forest algorithm
- Features include demographic information, location, education, employment, and access to technology
